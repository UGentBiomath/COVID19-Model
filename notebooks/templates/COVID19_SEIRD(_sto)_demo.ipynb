    "The SEIR(D) model was first proposed in 1929 by two Scottish scientists. It is a compartmental model that subdivides the human population into four groups: 1) susceptible individuals, 2) exposed individuals in the latent phase 1, 3) infectious individuals capable of transmitting the disease and 4) individuals removed from the population either through immunization or death. Despite being a simple and idealized reality, the SEIR(D) dynamics are used extensively to predict the outbreak of infectious diseases and this was no different during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak earlier this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we extend the SEIRD model to incorporate more expert knowledge on SARS-CoV-2. For that purpose, the infectious compartment is split into four parts. The first is a period of presymptomatic infectiousness because several studies have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission is a dominant transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. After the period of pre-symptomatic transmission, three possible infectious outcomes are modeled: (1) Asymptomatic outcome, for individuals who show no symptoms at all, (2) Mild outcome, for individuals with mild symptoms who recover at home, and (3) Hospitalization, when mild symptoms worsen. Children and young adults have a high propensity to experience an asymptomatic or mild outcome, while older individual have a high propensity to be hospitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Belgian hospitals have two wards for COVID-19 patients: 1) Cohort, where patients are not monitored permanently and 2) Intensive care, for patients with the most severe symptoms. Intensive care includes permanent monitoring, the use of ventilators or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients generally spend limited time in the emergency room and/or in a buffer ward before going to Cohort. After spending limited time in Cohort, some patients are transferred to ICU. Patients can perish in both wards, but mortalities are generally lower in Cohort. After a stay in an ICU, patients return to Cohort for recovery in the hospital. During the recovery stay, mortality is limited. The above is a short summary of hospital dynamics based on interviewing Ghent University hospital staff and examining the hospital data.\n",

We assume that the per contact transmission probability $\\beta$ is independent of age and we will infer its distribution by calibrating the model to national Belgian hospitalization data. The number of human-human interactions, $\\mathbf{N}_c$, are both place and age-dependent.

This is necessary because a contact was defined by Willem as any two-way conversation longer than 3 sentences. However, an infectious disease may only spread upon more 'intense' contact, hence the need to exclude or include contacts based on duration and intensity.

These data are used because they do not depend on the durations of the hospitalizations, $d_c$ and $d_{\\text{ICU}}$, which are computed from the limited and imperfect hospital dataset. In addition to the calibration of the transmission parameter $\\beta$, the number of days between the first infectious individuals entering the country and the onset of data collection (March 15th, 2020) must be estimated. The latter is denoted as excess time, $t_e$. Second, the daily hospitalizations ($H_{\\text{in}}$) from March 15th, 2020 until April 20th, 2020 were used to infer the slope of the compliance ramp ($l$), as well as the effect of prevention measures and *network* effects in the workplace and on public transport ($\\Omega$).\n",

We then used the obtained maximum-likelihood estimates as initial values for the ensemble sampler for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman 2010. For all parameters, uniform prior distributions were used. The sampler was always run on $2n$ parallel chains, were $n$ was the number of parameters to be sampled from the posterior distributions. For each chain, we drew at least 50-fold more samples than the autocorrelation time. Next, we visualised the samples using the scatterplot matrix proposed by Foreman (2016), further referred to as *cornerplot*. In these visualizations, each one- and two-dimensional projection of the sample is plotted to reveal correlations. During each step of the optimization procedure, previously sampled parameters were propagated.\n",
