    "The economic model uses the latest economic data from Belgium to estimate the impact of the pandemic. We gratefuly acknowledge professors Gert Peersman and Koen Schoors for the data and sharing their expert knowledge with us. In this implementation, it is used in conjunction with our age-layered extended SEIR model. The economic model will, at a later stage of development, also be used in conjuction with a network model."
