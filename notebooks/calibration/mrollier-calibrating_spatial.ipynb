    "1. What are the parameters sigma_H_in and extraTime that the MCMC is running over?\n",
    "    * `sigma_H_in` is the standard deviation of the data (that is estimated in the MLE as well); `extraTime` or `warmup` is the delay in time between the simulation and the data (this is virtually the same as varying over different initial conditions)\n",
    "2. What does `emcee.Ensemblesampler` do exactly? Reference: [this link](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/sampler/)\n",
    "3. Is it fair to start with an initialised model and only shift it horizontally? Isn't it possible to also run an MCMC on different initialisations?\n",
    "    * Yes, that is possible, but it appears that this does not make a difference\n",
    "4. What goes wrong when executing `fit_pso`? Arguably the model is not good.\n",
    "5. Would it be useful to use constraining functions in the PSO optimisation?\n",
    "6. What is the effect of using other `objective_fcn`s? Instead of `MLE` use `SSE`, for example. Are these 'choices', or is there a strong preference/necessity for one?\n",
    ">An explanation of the difference between SSE and MLE can be found [here](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/line/). Brief summary: if measurement noise is unbiased, Gaussian and independent than the MLE and SSE are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The example use in the function description of `MLE` function says `MLE(model,thetas,data,parNames,positions)`, but this does not correspond to the look of the function itself (`def MLE(thetas,BaseModel,data,states,parNames,samples=None):`). Is this some Python magic?\n",
    "    * Probably this is just old?\n",
    "8. PROBLEM -- For full calibration of every arrondissement *I will quite certainly need supercomputer time*. To calculate the maximum likelihood, a simulation is made every time. For 43 arrondissements and 5000 MCMC steps this means that on my pc this will need at least 20 hours to run. This problem **cannot** be circumvented by aggregating results, because this only happens a posteriori.\n",
    "9. PROBLEM -- As Tijs mentioned, it is difficult to define initial conditions in the calibration code that will work for the spatial model nicely. We have time series for every arrondissement and we have a model that predicts time series for every arrondissement, but any of those arrondissement time series is dependent on the initial conditions in *every* arrondissement, which is essentially a guess at this moment. A fit over any of the time series must be a best-fit of all time series at the same time, with the ideal combination of 43 initial conditions. This doesn't sound desirable, **but perhaps ...**\n",
    "    * What if the only varying initial condition is *where* we put the first exposed individual, combined with an overall translation (`extraTime`) and killing off all the 'dead paths' in the simulation (because it *didn't* die off)\n",
