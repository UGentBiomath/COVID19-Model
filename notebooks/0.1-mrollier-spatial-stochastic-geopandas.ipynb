    "1. What is the reason for and the meaning of the normalisation factor $z_i$ in `COVID19_SEIRD_sto_spatial`?\n",
    "2. Is it OK for all susceptibility factors $s_i$ to be smaller than one, as is the case now?\n",
    "3. Can we simulate home isolation within this framework? If the contact matrix $N_{c,ij}$ is set to only $N_{home,ij}$, this still assumes homogeneity within each patch. One than still has contact with the entire patch, which is not realistic\n",
    "4. Only professional commuting is included, but presumably this is not sufficient. Can we use these simulations to verify that?"
