    "\n",
    "1. What is the reason for and the meaning of the normalisation factor $z_i$ in `COVID19_SEIRD_sto_spatial`?\n",
    "2. Is it OK for all susceptibility factors $s_i$ to be smaller than one, as is the case now? Not a big deal, but seems odd and certainly changes the $\\beta$ value (such that it doesn't correspond to that of other research groups)\n",
    "3. Can we simulate home isolation within this framework? If the contact matrix $N_{c,ij}$ is set to only $N_{home,ij}$, this still assumes homogeneity within each patch. One than still has contact with the entire patch, which is not realistic\n",
    "4. Only professional commuting is included, but presumably this is not sufficient. Can we use these simulations to verify that? **MEETING 29 OCTOBER**\n",
    "5. ~~Why are there so few hospitalisations compared to the number of deaths? There is definitely a bug there somewhere: the number of ICUs is even larger than the number of hospitalisations, which cannot be correct.~~\n",
    "    * Probably because `H_in` literally shows how many new people get in at any day (flux only), while for example `ICU` shows how many people are *actively* occupying ICU beds. Of course there is a crucial difference between the two.\n",
    "6. ~~Why does it take SOOO much longer to compute the national model vs the spatial model? Verify whether this is a factor $G$ difference~~ Reason: the figure environment should be reloaded every time, otherwise the figures are overwritten, which takes a lot of memory.\n",
    "7. All numbers go up in the aggregated version compared to the national model. I would actually expect the opposite, because people aren't spread as homogenic as before. What is going on? This must be **the effect of the normalisation** ...but wouldn't this give the opposite effect? $z_i \\times f$ is of the order $0.5 \\times 1.5$ which brings *down* the infectivity, which lowers the probability of being infected in a patch $g$. So if anything, I would expect the time series to be smaller than on the national level.\n",
    "8. How do I implement multiple policy changes?"
