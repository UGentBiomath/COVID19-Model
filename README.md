## Introduction

Our code implements a SEIRS infectious disease dynamics model with extensions to model the effect of quarantining detected cases. Our code allows to perform Monte Carlo simulations, calibrate model parameters and calculate *optimal* government policies using a model predictive controller (MPC). A white paper and source code of our previous work can be found on the [BIOMATH website](https://biomath.ugent.be/covid-19-outbreak-modelling-and-control).

Check the [documentation website](https://ugentbiomath.github.io/COVID19-Model/) for more information about the code and the models.

## Demo

A demo of the model can be found [here](notebooks/templates/SEIRSAgeModel_demo.ipynb). This notebook can also be run in the browser through binder.
