       "mission, and may cause severe disease, especially in older individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has, in general, shown a remarkedly low incidence among children and young adults. Children have a lower susceptibility to infection and a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. Furthermore, pre-symptomatic transmission is a major contributor to SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n",
       "Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination and antiviral drugs are not yet available. On March 13th, 2020, the Belgian governments imposed strict social restrictions after tracing methods had failed to prevent large-scale spread of SARS-CoV-2. One and a half months later, the curve was succesfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually relaxed during the months of May, June and the beginning of July. In spite of these relaxations, hospitalizations kept declining. It is expected that during the coming year(s), preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, testing, contact tracing and quarantine. Hence the need for well-informed models that can assist policymakers in choosing the best non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of another large-scale SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Currently, two other models exist to make predictions for Belgium, the agent-based model of Willem et al. and the discrete-time, stochastic metapopulation model of Coletti et al.\n",
       "\n",
       "We built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified, extended SEIRD model and calibrated it to national Belgian hospitalization data. The model accounts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. Furthermore, the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, the severity of the disease and the susceptibility to a subclinical infection depend on the age of the individual. We used social contact rates from a 2012 study by Willem to model age-specific social mixing. Because detailed hospitalization data are not made publicly available by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Sciensano), we derived age-stratified hospitalization parameters from data of 370 patients treated in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. To overcome this unconstructive data policy, we used the computed hospitalization parameters as temporary proxies to fit the model to the total number of patients in Belgian hospitals and ICU units. Using the model, we computed the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) during the March 2020 epidemic. Because the model systematically overestimates the hospitalizations during lockdown relaxation, we re-estimated the basic reproduction using data from May 2020 until July 2020.\n",

       "## The model\n",
       "\n",
       "### Model dynamics\n",
       "\n",
       "The SEIR(D) model was first proposed in 1929 by two Scottish scientists. It is a compartmental model that subdivides the human population into four groups: 1) susceptible individuals, 2) exposed individuals in the latent phase 1, 3) infectious individuals capable of transmitting the disease and 4) individuals removed from the population either through immunization or death. Despite being a simple and idealized reality, the SEIR(D) dynamics are used extensively to predict the outbreak of infectious diseases and this was no different during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak earlier this year.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this work, we extend the SEIRD model to incorporate more expert knowledge on SARS-CoV-2. For that purpose, the infectious compartment is split into four parts. The first is a period of presymptomatic infectiousness because several studies have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission is a dominant transmission mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. After the period of pre-symptomatic transmission, three possible infectious outcomes are modeled: (1) Asymptomatic outcome, for individuals who show no symptoms at all, (2) Mild outcome, for individuals with mild symptoms who recover at home, and (3) Hospitalization, when mild symptoms worsen. Children and young adults have a high propensity to experience an asymptomatic or mild outcome, while older individual have a high propensity to be hospitalized.\n",
       "\n",
       "In general, Belgian hospitals have two wards for COVID-19 patients: 1) Cohort, where patients are not monitored permanently and 2) Intensive care, for patients with the most severe symptoms. Intensive care includes permanent monitoring, the use of ventilators or the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Patients generally spend limited time in the emergency room and/or in a buffer ward before going to Cohort. After spending limited time in Cohort, some patients are transferred to ICU. Patients can perish in both wards, but mortalities are generally lower in Cohort. After a stay in an ICU, patients return to Cohort for recovery in the hospital. During the recovery stay, mortality is limited. The above is a short summary of hospital dynamics based on interviewing Ghent University hospital staff and examining the hospital data.\n",

       "#### Age-stratification\n",
       "We introduced heterogeneity in the deterministic implementation by means of age-stratification. Every population compartment is split into a number of age classes, the age-groups have different contact rates with other age-groups and the disease progresses differently for each age-group, making the model behaviour more realistic. Our age-stratified model consists of 9 age classes, i.e., [0-10[, [10-20[, [20-30[, [30-40[, [40-50[, [50-60[, [60-70[, [70-80[, [80- $\\infty$[.
