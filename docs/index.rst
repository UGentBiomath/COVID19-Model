Welcome to covid19-model's documentation
========================================

.. _biomath_website : https://biomath.ugent.be/covid-19-outbreak-modelling-and-control

Our code implements a SEIRS infectious disease dynamics model with extensions to model the effect of quarantining detected cases. Our code allows to perform Monte Carlo simulations,
calibrate model parameters and calculate *optimal* government policies using a model predictive controller (MPC). A white paper and source code of our previous
work can be found on the `BIOMATH website <biomath_website>`_.

Demo
----

A demo of the model can be found [here](notebooks/templates/SEIRSAgeModel_demo.ipynb). This notebook can also be run in the browser through binder,
